            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on the Call of Duty League (CDL), a franchised competitive gaming organization. The goal is to design a poster that invites people to watch the matches while standing out from other posters yet remaining thematically consistent with the events. The goal of this project is to design an invitation poster for Call of Duty fans, specifically targeting hardcore fans of the Call of Duty League (CDL). The poster will inform them about the event and provide essential details.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I began by sketching initial concepts for the assignment. Next, I searched for a suitable template to establish the overall layout. Once I had a foundation, I adjusted the colors and theme to align more specifically with an OpTic Gaming event. I then gathered images of the OpTic competitive team and integrated them into the design. Finally, I added the event details, finalized the poster, and submitted the project. The poster meets the high expectations of fans while also capturing the excitement needed to draw in new viewers. It stays true to the authentic CDL atmosphere, making it both engaging and visually striking.</p>
