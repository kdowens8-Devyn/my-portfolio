            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The project was based on the restaurant Kobe Teppan & Sushi. The goal was to make a menu and business card for the restaurant and it needed to be authentic with clear text for customers to read. The restaurant needed a new menu and business card that replaces the old one they have.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I decided to make sure it was authentic but different enough since the old design was being replaced. For inspiration, I used the old design and looked for a lot of ideas that centered around Japanese customs. I ended up doing the red sun design since it was both simple and authentic. In the end, I think I made an authentic menu and business card with all the necessary information about the restaurant. The project was a successful replacement for the original menu and business card.</p>
