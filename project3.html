            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The project is me selecting my three personal favorite animations. Each animation is meant to represent some type of brand and make an advertisement of the topic. I created an advertisement combining Hollow Knight and the iPhone to attract new consumers while staying true to both brands. The project blends the game's artistic style with Apple's sleek aesthetic, highlighting the connection between immersive gaming and premium technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For Hollow Knight, it was to first make the iconic character in Hollow Knight and then make an animation that reminds fans of the game. This also allows new fans to get an insight into the game itself. For the iPhone, it was meant to highlight its unique functions as a way to show the improvement. Each animation embodies the essence of the Hollow Knight and iPhone brand while crafting an advertisement that captivates both longtime fans and newcomers alike.</p>
